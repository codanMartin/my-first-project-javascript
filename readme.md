# My First Project (JavaScript)

Imagine that you're the owner of a new small corner shop. You are doing well and want to determine how much you earned in the first month. Create a simple tool that will calculate your net income.
Upon completing this project, you can use this tool for your own accounting needs.

### ▶️ Stage 1/3: Print the prices

Start with printing the names of items and their prices using your first JavaScript function.

### ▶️ Stage 2/3: Measure the total income of your shop

You know how much you earned by selling each item. Calculate the total earnings before staff and other expenses!

### ▶️ Stage 3/3: Calculate net income

Measure the shop’s net income. Subtract staff, electricity, and security expenses.
